# afpp

Another f*cking pdf parser. (alpha)

## todo

- [x] pdf2string
- [ ] pdf2img
  
## Why?

If you are parsing pdf files in nodejs and you are satisfied with your actual solution, good for you, you don't need this.

But if youâ€™ve encountered one or more of these issues:

- package size (+30mb)
- blocking event loop
- performance issues
- buggy as shit
- not working in esm/commonjs
- old pdfjs-dist as peer dependency

then you might find this package useful.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+

## Getting started

`npm install afpp`

**commonjs**:

```js
const { pdf2string } = require("afpp");
const path = require("node:path");

const pathToFile = path.join("example.pdf");

(async function start() {
  const pdfString = await pdf2string(pathToFile);
  console.log(pdfString);
})();
```

**esm**:

```js
import { pdf2string } from "afpp";
import path from "node:path";

const pathToFile = path.join("example.pdf");

(async function start() {
  const pdfString = await pdf2string(pathToFile);
  console.log(pdfString);
})();
```
